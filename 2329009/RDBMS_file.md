## <p align="left"> Ques-1. Comparative study of various Database Management Systems</p>
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application or system that facilitates the creation, organization, storage, retrieval, and management of data in a structured and efficient manner.

## <p align="left"> Ques-2. Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL) </p>
### DDL (Data Definition Language):
DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database. DDL is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data. These commands are normally not used by a general user, who should be accessing the database via an application.

### **List of DDL commands:**
 
**CREATE:** This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers).

**DROP:** This command is used to delete objects from the database.

**ALTER:** This is used to alter the structure of the database.

**TRUNCATE:** This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.

**COMMENT:** This is used to add comments to the data dictionary.

**RENAME:** This is used to rename an object existing in the database.


## DML(Data Manipulation Language):
The SQL commands that deal with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements. It is the component of the SQL statement that controls access to data and to the database. Basically, DCL statements are grouped with DML statements.

### **List of DML commands:**

**INSERT:** It is used to insert data into a table.

**UPDATE:** It is used to update existing data within a table.

**DELETE:** It is used to delete records from a database table.


## DCL (Data Control Language):
DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system.

### **List of DCL commands:**

**GRANT:** This command gives users access privileges to the database.

**REVOKE:** This command withdraws the userâ€™s access privileges given by using the GRANT command.

## <p align="left"> Ques-3. How to apply Constraints at various levels. </p>

Constraints in the context of a relational database management system (RDBMS) are rules and conditions that are applied to the data in a database to ensure data integrity, accuracy, and consistency. They define the limitations and requirements for the data stored in database tables, helping to maintain the quality and reliability of the data. Constraints can be applied at various levels in a database, such as table level, column level, and database level. 

Some common types of constraints include:

### **Primary Key Constraint:**
Ensures that a column or a set of columns contains unique values, and no two rows can have the same values in the primary key column(s). It uniquely identifies each row in a table.
### **Unique Key**
Ensures that the values in a column or a set of columns are unique, but it doesn't necessarily require the uniqueness to identify each row. Multiple rows can have the same value as long as it's unique within the specified column(s).
### **Check Constraint**
Defines a condition or expression that must be true for data to be inserted or updated in a column. It allows you to enforce specific business rules or data validation.
### **Foreign Key**
Maintains referential integrity by linking a column in one table to the primary key of another table. This ensures that values in the foreign key column exist in the referenced table's primary key column.
### **Not Null**
Requires that a column cannot have a null (empty) value. It enforces the presence of data in the specified column.
### **Check Constraint**
Defines a condition that must be satisfied for data to be valid in a column. For example, you can use this constraint to enforce minimum or maximum values, data formats, or any custom business rules.

To apply constraints on a table named "student," you would typically use SQL statements. Here's an example of how you can create a "student" table with various constraints. Certainly, you can apply a foreign key constraint in the "student" table to establish a relationship with another table, such as a "courses" table. This relationship can represent the courses that each student is enrolled in. Here's an example of how to add a foreign key constraint to the "student" table:

``` python
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    date_of_birth DATE,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    major VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    GPA DECIMAL(3, 2) CHECK (GPA >= 0.0 AND GPA <= 4.0),
    course_enrolled INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (course_enrolled) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
);
```

To add data to the tables, you can use the SQL INSERT INTO statement as well.

``` python
-- Inserting sample data into the "courses" table
INSERT INTO courses (course_id, course_name)
VALUES
    (1, 'Introduction to Computer Science'),
    (2, 'Calculus I'),
    (3, 'Biology 101'),
    (4, 'History of Art'),
    (5, 'English Composition');

-- Inserting sample data into the "student" table
INSERT INTO student (student_id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, email, enrollment_date, major, new_gpa_column, course_enrolled)
VALUES
    (1, 'John', 'Doe', '1995-05-15', 'johndoe@example.com', '2023-09-01', 'Computer Science', 3.5, 1),
    (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', '1997-08-20', 'janesmith@example.com', '2023-09-01', 'Mathematics', 3.8, 2),
    (3, 'Alice', 'Johnson', '1998-03-10', 'alicejohnson@example.com', '2023-09-01', 'Biology', 3.2, 3);

```
