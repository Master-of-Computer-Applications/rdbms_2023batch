A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application or system that facilitates the creation, organization, storage, retrieval, and management of data in a structured and efficient manner. It serves as an intermediary between users or applications and the underlying database, providing tools and functionalities for data storage, access, security, and data integrity. DBMS systems are essential for effectively managing and manipulating data in various domains, including business, research, and software development.

There are numerous Database Management Systems (DBMS) available, each with its own features and strengths. Here are some of the well-known DBMS:
