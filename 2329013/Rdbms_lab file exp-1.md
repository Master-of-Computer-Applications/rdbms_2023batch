            Experiement-1:
 Comparative study of various Database                Management System:


A collection of information which is managed such that it can be updated and easily accessed is called a database. A 
software package which can be used to manipulate, validate and retrieve this database is called a Database 
Management System.

For example, Airlines use this software package to book tickets and confirm reservations which are then managed to 
keep a track of the schedule.

There are majorly four types of database:
Network Database: When the details of multiple members can be linked to the files of multiple owners and vice 
versa, it is called a network database.

Hierarchical Database: When the data stored in the form of records and is connected to each other through links is 
called hierarchical database. Each record comprises fields and each field comprises only one value.

Relational Database: When the data is organised as a set of tables comprising rows and columns with a pre-defined 
relationship with one another, it is called a relational database.

Object-oriented Database – the information is represented as objects, with different types of relationships possible 
between two or more objects. Such databases use an object-oriented programming language for development.

Components of Database Management Software

There four main components on which the working of a DBMS depends. This includes:
Data: The main component is the data. The entire database is set based on the data and the information processed 
based on it. This data acts as a bridge between the software and hardware components of DBMS. This can further be 
divided into three varieties:

User Data – The actual data based on which the work is done

Metadata – This is the data of the data, i.e., managing the data required to enter the information

Application MetaData – This is the structure and format of the queries

To simplify it, in a table, the information given in each table is the User Data, the number of tables, rows and 
columns is the MetaData the structure we choose is the Application MetaData.

Hardware: These are the general hardware devices which help us save and enter the data like hard disks, magnetic 
tapes, etc.

Software: The software acts as a medium of communication between the user and the database. Based on the user’s 
requirement, the database can be modified and updated. To perform operations on the data, query languages like
SQL are used.

Users: No function can be performed without the Users. Thus, they form the fourth most important component of 
DBMS. The information entered into a database is used by the User or the administrator to perform their business 
operations and responsibilities.

Benefits of Using Database Management System:-


Major Organisations and Banking firms choose to work using the Database Management System. It is because this 
system program helps the user and the administrator easily manage the data and information on the database. 

Given below are a few advantages of using a Database Management System:

Securing the data is easy. The administrator can restrict the usage of the database to a few people only. Thus, access 
to the database is restricted only to the administering team of an Organisation or Business which can keep the data 
safe
A single file can manage the entire database which is why duplicity and redundancy cannot happen. This makes the 
data more consistent and easy to update

Since tables can be created in DBMS, interrelating the data and elements with each other is convenient

The backup and recovery of data is managed by the software, which ensures that the database is secure at all times
It allows multi-users to operate the database at a single time, making it more efficient

Important Terms related to Database Management System


A few other important terms related to DBMS have been discussed in brief below. To understand this concept better, 
one must be aware of the following terms.
Data Manipulation Languages (DML) – This is a programming language used to insert or modify the data present in 
a database These are of two types: SQL and DDL.
Structured Query Language (SQL) – A programming language generally used for the relational database 
management system, which comprises tables. 
Data Definition Language (DDL) – It is a syntax which helps in modifying data present in the form of tables or 
indexes
Primary Key – Each file has a unique key. Using the Primary Key, a specific file can be identified
Foreign Key – The relation between a field in one table and component identified by a primary key can be detected using a Foreign Key
