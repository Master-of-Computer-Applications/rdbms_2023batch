## Definition of Commands
### Structured Query Language(SQL) as we all know is the database language by the use of which we can perform certain operations on the existing database and also we can use this language to create a database. SQL uses certain commands like CREATE, DROP, INSERT, etc. to carry out the required tasks. SQL commands are like instructions to a table. It is used to interact with the database with some operations. 
### It is also used to perform specific tasks, functions, and queries of data. SQL can perform various tasks like creating a table, adding data to tables, dropping the table, modifying the table, set permission for users.<br>

| Particular | Data Definition Language| Data Manipulation Language| Data Control Language| 
| :---:       | :---        |:----   |:--- | 
| Fullform | DDL stands for Data Definition Language | DDL stands for Data Manipulation Language | DDL stands for Data Control Language |
| Purpose |It defines the database structure or schema. | It is used to modify or manipulate the data in the database. | It is used to control the access to the data in the database. |
| Usage |DDL commands are typically executed by database administrators or schema designers. | DML commands are used by application developers, analysts, and end-users to interact with and manipulate data. | DCL commands are used by administrators to manage access and permissions. |
| Affects Data vs. Schema |DDL affects the schema of the database, modifying its structure and organization. | DML affects the data within the database, adding, modifying, or removing individual records. | DCL affects who can access what parts of the data and perform specific operations. |
| Transaction Control: |DDL commands are auto-committed and cannot be rolled back within a transaction. | DML commands can be committed (saved) or rolled back (undone) within a transaction. | DCL commands do not impact transaction control directly, as they manage access rather than data changes. |
| Security and Access Control: |DDL does not focus on security or access control but defines the overall structure of the database. | DML can be performed based on the permissions granted to users and roles. | DCL explicitly manages permissions, allowing or denying access to specific database objects for users and roles. |
| Example |  DDL commands are - CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, COMMENT ,RENAME | DDL commands are - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, CALL | DDL commands are - REVOKE, GRANT |
