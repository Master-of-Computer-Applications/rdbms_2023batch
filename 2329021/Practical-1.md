 # <p align="center">What is a database management system</p>
 <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a specialized software designed to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. It acts as a mediator between the database, applications, and user interfaces to manage and organize data effectively. The system provides a comprehensive suite of tools to govern databases, ensuring data security, consistency, and integrity.</p>

# <p align="center">Some key features of a DBMS include</p>
<p>
 <b>Data modeling:</b> A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data models, which define the structure and relationships of the data in a database.
<br><b>Data storage and retrieval:</b> A DBMS is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database, and can provide various methods for searching and querying the data.
<br><b>Concurrency control:</b> A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each other.
<br><b>Data integrity and security:</b> A DBMS provides tools for enforcing data integrity and security constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that restrict who can access the data.
<br><b>Backup and recovery:</b> A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure.
<br><b>DBMS can be classified into two types:</b> Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL)
<br><b>RDBMS:</b> Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns. The data is related to each other through primary and foreign keys.
<br><b>NoSQL:</b> Data is organized in the form of key-value pairs, document, graph, or column-based. These are designed to handle large-scale, high-performance scenarios.
