<p align="center">**My SQL**
MySQL is one of the most popular relational database systems. Originally an open-source solution, MySQL is now owned by Oracle Corporation. Today, MySQL is a pillar of LAMP application software. That means it’s a part of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Perl/PHP/Python stack. Having C and C++ under the hood, MySQL works well with such system platforms as Windows, Linux, MacOS, IRIX, and others.

**Pros of MySQL:-**
<br>
**Simple syntax and mild complexity**. MySQL’s structure and style are very plain. Developers even consider MySQL a database with a human-like language. MySQL is often used in tandem with the PHP programming language. Because they share a gentle learning curve, it’s much easier to form a team to manage your database. Also, MySQL is easy to use. For instance, most of the tasks can be executed right in the command line, reducing development steps.
<br>
**Cloud compatibility**. Business-oriented by nature and originally developed for the web, MySQL is supported by the most popular cloud providers. It’s available on leading platforms like Amazon, Microsoft, and others. This makes MySQL even more attractive and gives businesses room for growth.
<br>
**Cons of MySQL:-**
<br>
**Scalability challenges**. MySQL was not built with scalability in mind, which is inherent in its code. Theoretically, you can scale MySQL, but it will need more engineering effort than any of the NoSQL databases. So, if you expect one day your database will increase substantially, keep this limitation in mind or choose another DBMS option.
<br>
**Limited compliance with SQL standards**. Structured Query Language has specific standards. MySQL doesn’t completely follow them, i.e., MySQL provides no support for some standard SQL features. On the other hand, MySQL has some extensions and distinct features that don’t match the Structured Query Language standards. It’s not a big deal for small web applications. The issues may appear when you have to shift to other databases, which will likely happen when your business starts growing.
<br>
#<p align="center">**MariaDB**</p>
MariaDB, an open-source fork from MySQL, is a great SQL database example with commercial support. It works under a GNU General Public License and has similar commands, APIs, and libraries to MySQL.
<br>

**Pros of MariaDB:-**
<br>
**Encryption**. For MariaDB, open source doesn’t mean insecure. In addition to internal security and password check, MariaDB provides such features as PAM and LDAP authentication, Kerberos, and user roles.
<br>
**Broad functionality.** MariaDB has introduced a lot of new features in the last few years. For instance, GIS support suggests smooth coordinate storage and location data queries. Dynamic columns allow a single DBMS to provide both SQL and NoSQL data handling for different needs.
<br>
**High performance**. Although MariaDB originates from the MySQL engine, it’s gotten very far in terms of performance. Extensive optimization features improve thread pool management and data processing. Thus, when rows from the table are deleted, the operating system immediately accesses the free space, eliminating gaps in the tablespace.
<br>
**Cons of MariaDB:-**
<br>
**High cost**. Though the Oracle database has free editions, they are very limited in terms of functionality. Standard Edition, which doesn’t include all available features, costs $17,500 per unit. The Enterprise Edition is over $47,000 per unit.
<br>
**Resource-consuming technology**. The Oracle database needs powerful infrastructure. Not only does installation require a lot of disk space, but you’ll also have to consider constant hardware updates if you deploy it on-premises.
<br.
**Hard learning curve**. Oracle database is not a system to start using right away. It’s better to have certified Oracle DB engineers to run it. Oracle’s documentation, while covering many issues, can sometimes be overwhelming and even confusing. So, to install and run an Oracle database, you’ll have to consider hiring dedicated experts.
